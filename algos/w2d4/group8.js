const twoSums = (nums, target) => {};

// Given an array of integers, return indices of the
// two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

// You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution,
// and you may not use the same element twice.

// the array is unsorted, contains no floats, and there may be duplicate values

// Given nums = [2, 11, 7, 15], target = 9,
// Because nums[0] + nums[2] = 2 + 7 = 9,
// return [0, 2].
